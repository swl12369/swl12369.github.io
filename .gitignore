# Server specifics
server/uploads/*
!server/uploads/.gitkeep
server/db.json
server/users.json
# Note: Excluding users.json and db.json to prevent committing real data/credentials is standard,
# but for this specific user request to "upload the page", keeping the state (xManager account)
# is likely desired so it works immediately after cloning.
# We will NOT ignore them for this simplified workflow.
